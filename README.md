# Lesson 1
## What is JavaScript (JS) ?
A) It is a web based programming language. We can make  interactive weppages.
* Can build web and mobile apps
* create command tools
* Develop games
 
 ###### Knowinf HTML and CSS is helpful not it is not necessary that you must know it before learning JavaScript
 
**Things we need to Start our JavaScript jurney**

vs code and chrome



## The Connection of coding language and Frameworks



## Creating 1'st Executable file  
* In vs code we shall start by making files with this extension index.html, index.js, style.css
* HTML will be our main landing page.
* css is for styling elements


## HTML file
![14](14.png)
## JS file
![1](1.png)
## css is empty (we have not created for giving it styling)

# Variables
Variable is a container where we can store any data
##
![a](a.png)

## How to declace a variable?
* we have a put this keyword let to decale a variable after let we shall add a name for our variable like age later we shall assign a data to the variable like 23 and with console log we can print that data in inspect column
##
![2](2.png)

## 
We were able to create variable in js file now let us make it a viewable content on the main screen on html page (connecting html and js file)
##
Go to index.html and follow as shown
![3](3.png)
##
Go to index.js and follow as shown and see the output
![3.1](3.1.png)
##
Lets make 
# Arithmatic Expressions and re-Declaring Variables

![b](b.png)
## How to make rounding off of a number (Math expressions)
![8](8.png)
## Some more Mathematical expressions
![8.1](8.1.png)

## User Input with a button
* Silly method using js 
![4](4.png)

* Proper method using HTML
![4.2](4.2.png)
* In second method code you can see we have declared id which will help us connecting the files js and html (Code in Js)
* ![4.3](4.3.png)

## Data type
* Now we have been declaring variable and assigining data to it. to know what type of data we have to type simple line in code ```console.log(age)``` Then the output will be ```Number```
![6](6.png)

## Type Conversion
* We can chage DataType to ther format like ```Char``` to ```number```
![6](6.png)

# Variable (const)
* As the name only tells cannot change. ```let``` is a type of variable where we are able to change its type later in code to avoid that we shall make it const
![7](7.png)

# Making something interactive from what we have learnt till now
* We will make 3 buttons and will give styling this time and each buttons will have a particular action to be performed

* HTML code
* ![9](9.png)

* CSS code 
* ![9.1](9.1.png)

* JS code 
* ![10](10.png)
* That was out functional project

## Properties of string
*  CSS code 
* ![11](11.png)
* Some more commands on string
* * CSS code 
* ![12](12.png)

## Slicing 
* Used for getting exact required data from string
* ![15](15.png)
## Method Chaining
* method chaining = calling one method after another in one continuous line of code

* Old method 
* ![16](16.png)

* Chaining method
* ![16.1](16.1.png)

# If Statement 
* a basic form of decision-making if a condition is true, then do something if not, then don't do it! 
* Example
* ![17](17.png)

# Switch 
* statement that examines a value for a match against many case clauses. More efficient that many "else if" statements
* ![18](18.png)

# VAR variable
* It is better than let for sending data outside {}.
* if you are using let as variable 
* ![22](22.png)
* using var you can do this
* ![23](23.png)

# Array
* Think of it as a variable that can store multiple values
* ![24](24.png)
* Sorting of a array is to make elements display in order like alphabetic wise ```let fruits = ["banana","apple","orange","mango"];```
```fruits = fruits.sort(); //inorder```
```fruits = fruits.sort().reverse(); //in reverse order```
```for (let fruit of fruits){```
```     console.log(fruit);```
```     }```
